## Dataset

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | Cricsheet IPL JSON |
| Season | IPL 2026 |
| Matches (completed) | 72 |
| Ball-by-ball deliveries | 17,527 |
| Teams | 10 |
| Venues | 13 |

## Streamlit Application

The web app has 8 sections accessible from the sidebar:

### 1. Overview
Season dashboard with a KPI strip (matches, runs, teams, players, wickets, sixes), team run totals and win % charts, and season highlights (Orange Cap, Purple Cap, Champions).

### 2. Team Performance
- **Season Overview** — wins bar chart and runs scored vs conceded scatter
- **Team Deep-Dive** — win gauge, run breakdown, and phase-wise performance for any team
- **Head to Head** — side-by-side comparison of any two teams

### 3. Player Analysis
- **Leaderboard** — filter by balls faced, sort by runs / strike rate / sixes / fours / boundary %
- **Player Profile** — batting percentile radar, milestone scores, and bowling stats for all-rounders

### 4. Bowling Stats
- **Leaderboard** — filter by wickets, sort by economy / average / strike rate / hauls
- **Bowler Profile** — economy gauge and wicket haul breakdown (3W+, 4W+, 5W+)

### 5. Venue Analysis
- Average match scores and chase success rates across all grounds
- Per-venue deep-dive with chase success gauge and match summary

### 6. Match Explorer
- Run distribution and results breakdown across all 74 matches
- Per-match innings comparison and full result details

### 7. Data Explorer
Query the dataset through pre-built questions — no code needed. Pick a category (Team, Batting, Bowling, Phase, Venue, Match, Comparison), choose a question, and results render instantly as a chart or metric.

### 8. Match Prediction
Select two teams and predict the winner using the trained Random Forest model. Shows win probability gauges for both teams.

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rithunrajendran/IPL-2026-Cricket-Analytics-Platform.git
cd IPL-2026-Cricket-Analytics-Platform
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit/app.py
```

## Machine Learning

**Objective:** Predict match winner (binary classification — Team 1 wins or not)

**Model:** Random Forest (selected after comparing 4 models)

| Model | CV Accuracy | Std Dev |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | **57.62%** | 12.47% |
| Extra Trees | 56.50% | 11.91% |
| Logistic Regression | 53.16% | 12.12% |
| Gradient Boosting | 52.82% | 9.12% |

**Features (13):**
`team1`, `team2`, `venue`, `team1_prev_win_pct`, `team2_prev_win_pct`, `team1_recent_form`, `team2_recent_form`, `team1_avg_runs`, `team2_avg_runs`, `team1_avg_conceded`, `team2_avg_conceded`, `toss_winner_is_team1`, `toss_decision`

Historical features are calculated chronologically — no data leakage from future matches.

> **Note:** 57.6% accuracy reflects a single-season dataset of 72 matches. T20 outcomes are inherently hard to predict; this is an experimental baseline.

## SQL Analytics Layer

Database: `ipl_analytics`

**Tables:** `matches_2026`, `deliveries_2026`

**Views:**
`vw_match_analytics` · `vw_venue_performance` · `vw_team_performance` · `vw_batting_performance` · `vw_bowling_performance` · `vw_phase_performance` · `vw_toss_impact` · `vw_match_results` · `vw_head_to_head` · `vw_chasing_vs_defending`

Concepts demonstrated: JOINs, GROUP BY, CASE, CTEs, aggregations, window functions, ranking, conditional calculations.
